  🚀 GETTING STARTED:
  1. Open the app after installation

  4. Go to Admin → Settings to choose Full or Pruned node mode
  5. Set your wallet addresses in your profile settings
  6. Connect your miners and start mining!

  💾 NODE MODE: Choose between Full nodes (requires ~500GB+, keeps
  full blockchain history) or Pruned nodes (requires ~50GB, saves
  disk space). Change this in Admin → Settings after setup.

  Connect your ASICs:

  - Scrypt miners: stratum+tcp://YOUR_UMBREL_IP:3333

  Use your wallet address as the username when connecting miners.

  ⚠️ DISK SPACE: This app runs 11 blockchain daemons and requires
  approximately 500GB+ of disk space for full sync. Ensure your
  Umbrel has sufficient storage before installing.
