  💾 NODE MODE: Choose between Full nodes (requires ~500GB+, keeps
  full blockchain history) or Pruned nodes (requires ~50GB, saves
  disk space). Change this in Admin → Settings after setup.

  ⚠️ DISK SPACE: This app runs 9 blockchain daemons and requires
  approximately 200GB+ of disk space for full sync. Ensure your
  Umbrel has sufficient storage before installing.
